# pyManager

PyManager is a work-in-progress Python script meant to assist it's users in managing their files, among other future planned features. as of right now, the FileManger portion of the script is being built. I will add updates to this progress list in the future:

![50% done with FileManager](https://progress-bar.dev/80/?title=FileManager)
![1% done with Automation](https://progress-bar.dev/1/?title=Automation)

## Requirements

+ [watchdog](https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog) for shell management features and automation
+ [send2trash](https://github.com/arsenetar/send2trash) for sending duplicate files to the trash.
